# Assignment #2 - Edit the template
Intro
#### Edit the template
Edit your prototype
In the outline ( bottom left corner ) Select “Wizard Step Product type”. Delete all its children ( Message Strip, Text and Horizontal Box ). You can do this either in Wizard step properties ( to the right of the screen ) or just remove them from the outline.

Go to controls in the upper left corner. Search for the “Form” control and either drag it in the UI editor, or you can drag it into the outline.

Change the title of this step to: “Enter Your Information”. You can again do this by selecting the Wizard Step in the outline and then go to properties of the Wizard Step (to the right side of the screen) then locate the Title input field to edit the Title there. Or you can select it in the UI Editor and edit the Title there. 

We don’t need two titles for this step so lets remove the Title Form Title from the Form control. We also won't be needing the bottom two Form Rows so lets delete those as well.

Now lets change the labels of the first two Form Rows to "Zip Code" and "House Number". Again you can do this in the outline or by double clicking on the label in the UI editor. Also we have to change out the Dropdown List in the bottom Form Row for another Input field.
Great, we have our input fields in place now they are just a bit too wide. Lets go to their properties and adjust the first one to 20%, and the second one to 10%.
